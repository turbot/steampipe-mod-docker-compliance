## Description

Audit the `docker.socket` if applicable. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit the Docker daemon. Because this daemon runs with root privileges, it is very important
to audit its activities and usage. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories with `docker.socket` being one such file, and as this holds various parameters for the Docker daemon, it should be audited.

## Remediation

If the file exists, a rule for it should be added.
For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /var/run/docker.sock -k docker
```
Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value:

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file `docker.socket`
may not be present, but if it is, it should be audited.
