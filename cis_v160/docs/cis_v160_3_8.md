## Description

You should verify that all the registry certificate files (usually found under
`/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>` directory) have permissions of `444` or are set
more restrictively.

**Note** that, by default, this directory might not exist if no registry certificate files are in
place.

The `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>` directory contains Docker registry
certificates. These certificate files must have permissions of `444` or more restrictive
permissions in order to ensure that unprivileged users do not have full access to them.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
find /etc/docker/certs.d/ -type f -exec chmod 0444 {} \;
```

This would set the permissions for the registry certificate files to `444`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for registry certificate files might not be `444`. The default file
permissions are governed by the system or user specific `umask` values which are
defined within the operating system itself.
