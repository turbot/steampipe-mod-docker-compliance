## Description

You should add the HEALTHCHECK instruction to your Docker container images in order to ensure that health checks are executed against running containers.

An important security control is that of availability. Adding the HEALTHCHECK instruction to your container image ensures that the Docker engine periodically checks the running container instances against that instruction to ensure that containers are still operational.

Based on the results of the health check, the Docker engine could terminate containers which are not responding correctly, and instantiate new ones.

## Remediation

You should follow the Docker documentation and rebuild your container images to include the HEALTHCHECK instruction.

### Default Value:

By default, HEALTHCHECK is not set.
