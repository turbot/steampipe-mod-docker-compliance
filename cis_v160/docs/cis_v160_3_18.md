## Description

You should verify that if the `daemon.json` is present its file permissions are correctly set
to `644` or more restrictively.

The `daemon.json` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the
docker daemon. Therefore it should be writeable only by `root` to ensure it is not
modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

If the `daemon.json` file is present, you should execute the command below:

```bash
chmod 644 /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

This sets the file permissions for this file to `644`.

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system, and in that case, this recommendation is not applicable.
