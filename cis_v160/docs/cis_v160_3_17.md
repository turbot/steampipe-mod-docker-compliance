## Description

You should verify that the `daemon.json` file individual ownership and group ownership is correctly set to `root`, if it is in use.

The `daemon.json` file contains sensitive parameters that could alter the behavior of the docker daemon. It should therefore be owned and group owned by root to ensure it can not be modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

If the daemon.json file is present, you should execute the command below:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

This sets the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`.

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system, and in that case, this recommendation is not applicable.
