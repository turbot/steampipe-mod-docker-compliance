## Description

The iptables firewall is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules within the Linux kernel. The Docker daemon should be allowed to make changes to the `iptables` ruleset.

Docker will never make changes to your system iptables rules unless you allow it to do so. If you do allow this, Docker server will automatically make any required changes. We recommended letting Docker make changes to iptables automatically in order to avoid networking misconfigurations that could affect the communication between containers and with the outside world. Additionally, this reduces the administrative overhead of updating iptables every time you add containers or modify networking options.

## Remediation

Do not run the Docker daemon with --iptables=false parameter. For example, do not
start the Docker daemon as below:

```bash
dockerd --iptables=false
```

### Default Value:

By default, `iptables` is set to `true`.
