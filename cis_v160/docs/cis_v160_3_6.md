## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/docker` directory permissions are correctly set to `755` or `more` restrictively

The `/etc/docker` directory contains certificates and keys in addition to various sensitive
files. It should therefore only be writeable by `root` to ensure that it can not be modified
by a less privileged user.

## Remediation

You should run the following command:

```bash
chmod 755 /etc/docker
```

This sets the permissions for the directory to `755`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for this directory are set to `755`.
