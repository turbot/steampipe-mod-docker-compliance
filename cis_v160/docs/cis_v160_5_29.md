## Description

You should use the --pids-limit flag at container runtime.

Attackers could launch a fork bomb with a single command inside the container. This fork bomb could crash the entire system and would require a restart of the host to make the system functional again. Using the PIDs cgroup parameter --pids-limit would prevent this kind of attack by restricting the number of forks that can happen inside a container within a specified time frame.

## Remediation

Use --pids-limit flag with an appropriate value when launching the container. For example:

```bash
docker run -it --pids-limit 100 <Image ID>
```

In the above example, the number of processes allowed to run at any given time is set to 100. After a limit of 100 concurrently running processes is reached, Docker would restrict any new process creation.

### Default Value:

The Default value for --pids-limit is 0 which means there is no restriction on thenumber of forks. Note that the PIDs cgroup limit works only for kernel versions 4.3 and higher.
