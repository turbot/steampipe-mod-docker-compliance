## Description

You should use native Docker authorization plugins or a third party authorization
mechanism with the Docker daemon to manage access to Docker client commands.

Docker’s out-of-the-box authorization model is currently "all or nothing". This means that
any user with permission to access the Docker daemon can run any Docker client
command. The same is true for remote users accessing Docker’s API to contact the
daemon. If you require greater access control, you can create authorization plugins and
add them to your Docker daemon configuration. Using an authorization plugin, a Docker
administrator can configure granular access policies for managing access to the Docker
daemon.

Third party integrations of Docker may implement their own authorization models to
require authorization with the Docker daemon outside of docker's native authorization
plugin (i.e. Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Openshift).

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Install/Create an authorization plugin.
**Step 2:** Configure the authorization policy as desired.
**Step 3:** Start the docker daemon as below:
```bash
dockerd --authorization-plugin=<PLUGIN_ID>
```

### Default Value:

By default, authorization plugins are not set up.
