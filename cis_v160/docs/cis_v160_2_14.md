## Description

By default you should restrict containers from acquiring additional privileges via `suid` or
`sgid`.

A process can set the `no_new_priv` bit in the kernel and this persists across forks,
clones and execve. The `no_new_priv` bit ensures that the process and its child
processes do not gain any additional privileges via suid or sgid bits. This reduces the
security risks associated with many dangerous operations because there is a much
reduced ability to subvert privileged binaries.

Setting this at the daemon level ensures that by default all new containers are restricted
from acquiring new privileges.

## Remediation

You should run the Docker daemon as below:

```bash
dockerd --no-new-privileges
```

### Default Value:

By default, containers are not restricted from acquiring new privileges.
