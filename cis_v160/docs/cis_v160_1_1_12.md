## Description

Audit the `/etc/containerd/config.toml` if applicable. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with `root` privileges and its behavior depends on some key files and directories. `/etc/containerd/config.toml` is one such file. It holds various parameters related to the Docker daemon and should therefore be audited.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/etc/containerd/config.toml` file
For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/containerd/config.toml -k docker
```

Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file
`/etc/containerd/config.toml` may not exist on the system and in that case, this
recommendation is not applicable.
