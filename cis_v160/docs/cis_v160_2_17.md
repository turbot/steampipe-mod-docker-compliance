## Description

You can choose to apply a custom `seccomp` profile at a `daemon-wide `level if needed with this overriding Docker's default `seccomp` profile.

A large number of system calls are exposed to every userland process with many of them not utilized during the entire lifetime of the process. Many applications do not need all these system calls and therefore benefit by having each system call currently in use reviewed in line with organizational security policy. A reduced set of system calls reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application and therefore improves application security.

A custom seccomp profile can be applied instead of Docker's default seccomp profile. Alternatively, if Docker's default profile is adequate for your environment, you can choose to ignore this recommendation.

## Remediation

By default, Docker's default seccomp profile is applied. If this is adequate for your environment, no action is necessary. Alternatively, if you choose to apply your own seccomp profile, use the `--seccomp-profile` flag at daemon start or put it in the daemon runtime parameters file.

```bash
dockerd --seccomp-profile </path/to/seccomp/profile>
```

### Default Value

By default, Docker applies a default seccomp profile.
