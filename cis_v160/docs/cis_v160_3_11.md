## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed along with
the `--tlscert` parameter) is individual owned and group owned by `root`.

The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on the given server certificate. It must therefore be individually owned and group owned by root to prevent modification by less privileged users.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chown root:root <path to Docker server certificate file>
```

This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the Docker server certificate file to `root`.

### Default Value

By default, the ownership and group-ownership for Docker server certificate file is correctly set to `root`.
