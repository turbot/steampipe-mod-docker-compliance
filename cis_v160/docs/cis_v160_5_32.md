## Description

The Docker socket `docker.sock` should not be mounted inside a container.

If the Docker socket is mounted inside a container it could allow processes running within the container to execute Docker commands which would effectively allow for full control of the host.

## Remediation

You should ensure that no containers mount docker.sock as a volume.

### Default Value

By default, `docker.sock` is not mounted inside containers.
