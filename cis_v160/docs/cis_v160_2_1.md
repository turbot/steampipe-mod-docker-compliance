## Description

Rootless mode executes the Docker daemon and containers inside a user namespace, with both the daemon and the container are running without root privileges. Rootless mode allows running the Docker daemon and containers as a non-root user to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the daemon and the container runtime

## Remediation

Follow the current Docker documentation on how to install the Docker daemon as a non-root user

### Default Value

The Docker daemon is running as the root user by default.
