## Description

You should verify that the `docker.socket` file ownership and group ownership are
correctly set to `root`.

The `docker.socket` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the
Docker remote API. For this reason, it should be owned and group owned by `root` in
order to ensure that it is not modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.socket
```

**Step 2:** : If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file exists,
execute the command below, including the correct file path to set the ownership and
group ownership for the file to `root`. For example,

```bash
chown root:root /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket
```

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system. In that case, this recommendation is not applicable. By default, if the file is present, the ownership and group ownership for it should be set to `root`.
