## Overview

This section covers security recommendations that you should follow to prepare the host machine that you plan to use for executing containerized workloads. Securing the Docker host and following your infrastructure security best practices would build a solid and secure foundation for executing containerized workloads.

## Note

The section `cis_v160_1_1_1` to `cis_v160_1_1_18` controls are evaluated using `auditctl` a command line tool compatible to Linux OS. As Mac OS does not support `auditctl`, when the related benchmark `cis_v160_1_1` is executed from Mac OS, all these controls are skipped while the query evaluates the targeted OS.

The controls are only evaluated when executed in Linux OS in following ways

- Using [Exec](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/exec) plugin, which allows to connect your remote docker host.
- Directly in the Linux server, where Docker is hosted. If you want to execute benchmark in the Docker server, you need to follow required installations such as
  - [Steampipe CLI](https://steampipe.io/downloads)
  - [Steampipe plugin](https://steampipe.io/downloads)
  - [Docker plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/docker)
  - [Exec Plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/exec)
