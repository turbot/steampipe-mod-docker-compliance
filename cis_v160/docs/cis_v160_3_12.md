## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed along with
the `--tlscert` parameter) has permissions of `444` or more restrictive permissions.

The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to
authenticate the Docker server based on the given server certificate. It should therefore
have permissions of `444` to prevent its modification.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chmod 444 <path to Docker server certificate file>
```
This sets the file permissions of the Docker server certificate file to `444`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Docker server certificate file might not be `444`. The
default file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific `umask`
values.
