## Description

All Docker containers and their data and metadata is stored under `/var/lib/docker`
directory. By default, `/var/lib/docker`should be mounted under either the `/` or `/var`
partitions dependent on how the Linux operating system in use is configured.

## Remediation

For new installations, you should create a separate partition for the `/var/lib/docker`
mount point. For systems which have already been installed, you should use the Logical
Volume Manager (LVM) within Linux to create a new partition.

### Default Value:

By default, `/var/lib/docker` is mounted under the `/` or `/var` partitions dependent on
how the OS is configured.
