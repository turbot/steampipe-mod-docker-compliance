## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file permissions are correctly set to
`644` or more restrictively.

The `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the
behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be writeable only by `root` in order to
ensure that it is not modified by less privileged users

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chmod 644 /etc/sysconfig/docker
```

This sets the file permissions for this file to `644`.

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system and in this case, this recommendation is not applicable.
