## Description

You should verify that the `docker.service` file ownership and group ownership are correctly set to `root`.

The `docker.service` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be individually and group owned by the `root` user in order to ensure that it is not modified or corrupted by a less privileged user.

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service
```

**Step 2:** If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file does
exist, you should execute the command below, including the correct file path, in order to
set the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`. For example,

```bash
chown root:root /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
```

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system and if it is not, this recommendation is not
applicable. By default, if the file is present, the correct permissions are for the ownership
and group ownership to be set to `root`.
