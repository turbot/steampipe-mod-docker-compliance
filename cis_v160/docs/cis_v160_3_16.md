## Description

You should verify that the Docker socket file has permissions of `660` or are configured more restrictively.

Only root and the members of the docker group should be allowed to read and write to the default Docker Unix socket. The Docker socket file should therefore have
permissions of `660` or more restrictive permissions.


## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

This sets the file permissions of the Docker socket file to `660`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Docker socket file is correctly set to `660`.
