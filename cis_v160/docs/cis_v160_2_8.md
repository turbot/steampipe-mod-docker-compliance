## Description

Set the default ulimit options as appropriate in your environment.

`ulimit` provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes which
it starts. Setting system resource limits judiciously can save you from disasters such as
a fork bomb. On occasion, even friendly users and legitimate processes can overuse
system resources and can make the system unusable.
Setting the default ulimit for the Docker daemon enforces the ulimit for all container
instances. In this case you would not need to setup ulimit for each container instance.
However, the default ulimit can be overridden during container runtime, if needed.
Therefore, in order to have proper control over system resources, define a default ulimit
as is needed in your environment.

## Remediation

Run Docker in daemon mode and pass --default-ulimit as argument with respective
ulimits as appropriate in your environment and in line with your security policy.
For Example,

```bash
dockerd --default-ulimit nproc=1024:2048 --default-ulimit nofile=100:200
```

### Default Value

By default, no ulimit is set.
