## Description

Under certain circumstances, you might need containers larger than 10G. Where this
applies you should carefully choose the base device size.

The base device size can be increased on daemon restart. Increasing the base device
size allows all future images and containers to be of the new base device size. A user
can use this option to expand the base device size, however shrinking is not permitted.
This value affects the system wide “base” empty filesystem that may already be
initialized and therefore inherited by pulled images.

Although the file system does not allocate the increased size as long as it is empty,
more space will be allocated for extra images. This may cause a denial of service
condition if the allocated partition becomes full.

## Remediation

Do not set `--storage-opt dm.basesize` until needed.


### Default Value

The default base device size is 10G.
