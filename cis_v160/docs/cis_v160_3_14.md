## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed along
with the `--tlskey` parameter) has permissions of `400`.

The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any tampering or
unneeded reads. It holds the private key for the Docker server certificate. It must
therefore have permissions of `400` to ensure that the certificate key file is not modified.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chmod 400 <path to Docker server certificate key file>
```
This sets the Docker server certificate key file permissions to `400`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Docker server certificate key file might not be `400`.
The default file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific `umask` values.
