## Description

You should verify that the docker.service file permissions are either set to `644` or to a more restrictive value.

The `docker.service` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be individually and group owned by the `root` user in order to ensure that it is not modified or corrupted by a less privileged user.

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service
```

**Step 2:** : If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file exists,
execute the command below including the correct file path to set the file permissions to `644`. For example

```bash
chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
```

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system. In that case, this recommendation is not
applicable. By default, if the file is present, the file permissions are correctly set to `644`.
