## Description

You should verify that all the registry certificate files (usually found under
`/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>` directory) are individually owned and group
owned by `root`.

The `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>` directory contains Docker registry
certificates. These certificate files must be individually owned and group owned by root
to ensure that less privileged users are unable to modify the contents of the directory.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chown root:root /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-name>/*
```

This would set the individual ownership and group ownership for the registry certificate files to `root`.

### Default Value

By default, the individual ownership and group ownership for registry certificate files is
correctly set to `root`.
