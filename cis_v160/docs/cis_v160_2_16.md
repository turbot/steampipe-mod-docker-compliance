## Description

The Docker daemon starts a userland proxy service for port forwarding whenever a port
is exposed. Where hairpin NAT is available, this service is generally superfluous to
requirements and can be disabled

The Docker engine provides two mechanisms for forwarding ports from the host to
containers, hairpin NAT, and the use of a userland proxy. In most circumstances, the
hairpin NAT mode is preferred as it improves performance and makes use of native
Linux iptables functionality instead of using an additional component.

Where hairpin NAT is available, the userland proxy should be disabled on startup to
reduce the attack surface of the installation

## Remediation

You should run the Docker daemon as below:

```bash
dockerd --userland-proxy=false
```

### Default Value

By default, the userland proxy is enabled.
