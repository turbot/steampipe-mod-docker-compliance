## Description

You should verify that the Containerd socket file has permissions of `660` or are configured more restrictively.

Only root and the members of the `root` group should be allowed to read and write to the default Containerd Unix socket. The Containerd socket file should therefore have permissions of `660` or more restrictive permissions.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chmod 660 /run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

This sets the file permissions of the Containerd socket file to `660`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for the Containerd socket file is correctly set to `660`.
