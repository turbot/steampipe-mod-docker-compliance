## Description

You should not use `docker exec` with the `--privileged` option

Using the `--privileged` option in `docker exec` commands gives extended Linux capabilities to the command. This could potentially be an insecure practice, particularly when you are running containers with reduced capabilities or with enhanced restrictions.

## Remediation

You should not use the `--privileged` option in docker exec commands

### Default Value

By default, the `docker exec` command runs without the `--privileged` option
