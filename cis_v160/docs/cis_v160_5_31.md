## Description

You should not share the host's user namespaces with containers running on it.

User namespaces ensure that a root process inside the container will be mapped to a non-root process outside the container. Sharing the user namespaces of the host with the container does not therefore isolate users on the host from users in the containers.

## Remediation

You should not share user namespaces between host and containers. For example, you should not run the command below:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --userns=host ubuntu bash
```

### Default Value

By default, the host user namespace is shared with containers unless user namespace support is enabled.
