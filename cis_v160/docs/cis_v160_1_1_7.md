## Description

Audit the `docker.service` if applicable. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges
and its behavior depends on some key files and directories with `docker.service` being one such file. The `docker.service` file might be present if the daemon parameters have been changed by an administrator. If so, it holds various parameters for the Docker daemon and should be audited.

## Remediation

If the file exists, a rule for it should be added.
For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service -k docker
```
Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value:

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file `docker.service`
may not be present on the system.
