## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/docker` directory ownership and group ownership is
correctly set to `root`.

The `/etc/docker` directory contains certificates and keys in addition to various other
sensitive files. It should therefore be individual owned and group owned by `root` in order
to ensure that it can not be modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

To resolve this issue you should run the following command:
```bash
chown root:root /etc/docker
```
This sets the ownership and group ownership for the directory to root.

### Default Value

By default, the ownership and group ownership for this directory is correctly set to `root`.
