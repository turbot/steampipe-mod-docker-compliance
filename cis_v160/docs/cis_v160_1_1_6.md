## Description

Audit `/etc/docker`. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges and its behaviour depends on some key files and directories. `/var/lib/docker` is one such directory. As it holds all the information about containers it should be audited.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/etc/docker` directory.
For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/docker -k docker
```
Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited.
