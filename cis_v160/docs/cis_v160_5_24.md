## Description

You should not use `docker exec` with the `--user=root` option.

Using the `--user=root` option in a `docker exec` command, executes it within the
container as the root user. This could potentially be insecure, particularly when you are
running containers with reduced capabilities or enhanced restrictions.

For example, if your container is running as a tomcat user (or any other non-root user),
it would be possible to run a command through `docker exec` as root with the `--user=root` option. This could potentially be dangerous.

## Remediation

You should not use the `--user=root` option in `docker exec` commands.

### Default Value

By default, the `docker exec` command runs without the `--user` option.
