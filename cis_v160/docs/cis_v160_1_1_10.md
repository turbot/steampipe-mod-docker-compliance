## Description

Audit the `/etc/default/docker` if applicable. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges and its behavior depends on some key files and directories. `/etc/default/docker` is one such file. It holds various parameters related to the Docker daemon and should therefore be audited.

## Remediation

You should add a rule for the `/etc/default/docker` file
For example,
Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /etc/default/docker -k docker
```
Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command

```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited so these defaults should
be changed in line with organizational security policy. The file `/etc/default/docker`
may not be present, and if so, this recommendation is not applicable.
