## Description

It is possible to make the Docker daemon available remotely over a TCP port. If this is
required, you should ensure that TLS authentication is configured in order to restrict
access to the Docker daemon via IP address and port.

By default, the Docker daemon binds to a non-networked Unix socket and runs with
root privileges. If you change the default Docker daemon binding to a TCP port or any
other Unix socket, anyone with access to that port or socket could have full access to
the Docker daemon and therefore in turn to the host system. For this reason, you
should not bind the Docker daemon to another IP/port or a Unix socket.

If you must expose the Docker daemon via a network socket, you should configure TLS
authentication for the daemon and for any Docker Swarm APIs (if they are in use). This
type of configuration restricts the connections to your Docker daemon over the network
to a limited number of clients who have access to the TLS client credentials.

## Remediation

Follow the steps mentioned in the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/) or other references.

### Default Value:

By default, TLS authentication is not configured.
