## Description

You should verify that the file permissions on the `docker.socket` file are correctly set to `644` or more restrictively.

The `docker.socket` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior of the Docker remote API. It should therefore be writeable only by root in order to ensure that it is not modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

**Step 1:** Find out the file location:

```bash
systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.socket
```

**Step 2:** :  If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file does
exist, you should execute the command below, including the correct file path to set the
file permissions to `644`. For example,

```bash
chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket
```

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system and in that case, this recommendation is not
applicable. By default, if the file is present, the permissions should be set to `644` or more restrictively.
