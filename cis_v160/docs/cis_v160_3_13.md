## Description

You should verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed along
with the `--tlskey` parameter) is individually owned and group owned by `root`.

The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any tampering or
unneeded reads/writes. As it holds the private key for the Docker server certificate, it
must be individually owned and group owned by `root` to ensure that it cannot be
accessed by less privileged users.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chown root:root <path to Docker server certificate key file>
```
This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the Docker server certificate key file to `root`.

### Default Value

By default, the individual ownership and group ownership for the Docker server certificate key file is correctly set to `root`.
