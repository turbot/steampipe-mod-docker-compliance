## Description

You should verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed along with the --
`tlscacert` parameter) has permissions of `444` or is set more restrictively

The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to
authenticate the Docker server based on a given CA certificate. It must therefore have
permissions of `444`, or more restrictive permissions to ensure that the file cannot be
modified by a less privileged user.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chmod 444 <path to TLS CA certificate file>
```

This sets the file permissions on the TLS CA file to `444`.

### Default Value

By default, the permissions for the TLS CA certificate file might not be `444`. The default
file permissions are governed by the operating system or user specific `umask` values.
