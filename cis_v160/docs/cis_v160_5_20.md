## Description

Mount propagation mode allows mounting volumes in shared, slave or private mode on a container. Do not use shared mount propagation mode unless explicitly needed.

A shared mount is replicated at all mounts and changes made at any mount point are propagated to all other mount points.

Mounting a volume in shared mode does not restrict any other container from mounting and making changes to that volume.

As this is likely not a desirable option from a security standpoint, this feature should not be used unless explicitly required.

## Remediation

Do not mount volumes in shared mode propagation. For example, do not start a container as below:

```bash
docker run <Run arguments> --volume=/hostPath:/containerPath:shared
<Container Image Name or ID> <Command>
```

### Default Value:

By default, the container mounts are private.
