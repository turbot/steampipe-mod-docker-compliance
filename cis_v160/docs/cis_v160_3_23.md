## Description

You should verify that the Containerd socket file is owned by `root` and group owned by `root`.

Containerd is an underlying component used by Docker to create and manage
containers. It provides a socket file similar to the Docker socket, which must be
protected from unauthorized access. If any other user or process owns this socket, it
might be possible for that non-privileged user or process to interact with the Containerd
daemon. Additionally, in this case a non-privileged user or process might be able to
interact with containers which is neither a secure nor desired behavior.

Unlike the Docker socket, there is usually no requirement for non-privileged users to
connect to the socket, so the ownership should be `root:root`.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chown root:root /run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

This sets the ownership to `root` and group ownership to root for the default Containerd socket file.

### Default Value

By default, the ownership and group ownership for the Containerd socket file is correctly set to `root:root`
