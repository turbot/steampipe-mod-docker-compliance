## Description

Content trust is disabled by default and should be enabled in line with organizational security policy.

Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the identity and the publisher of specific image tags and ensures the provenance of container images.

## Remediation

To enable content trust in a bash shell, you should enter the following command:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

Alternatively, you could set this environment variable in your profile file so that content trust in enabled on every login.

### Default Value

By default, content trust is disabled.
