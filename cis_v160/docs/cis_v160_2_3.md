## Description

Set Docker daemon log level to info.

Setting up an appropriate log level, configures the Docker daemon to log events that you would want to review later. A base log level of `info` and above would capture all logs except debug logs. Until and unless required, you should not run Docker daemon at `debug` log level.

## Remediation

Ensure that the Docker daemon configuration file has the following configuration included

```bash
"log-level": "info"
```

Alernatively, run the docker daemon as below

```bash
dockerd --log-level="info"
```

### Default Value:

By default, Docker daemon is set to log level of `info`.
