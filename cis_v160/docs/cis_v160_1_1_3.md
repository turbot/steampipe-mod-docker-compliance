## Description

Audit all Docker daemon activities. As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit the Docker daemon. Because this daemon runs with root privileges. It is very important
to audit its activities and usage.

## Remediation

You should add rules for the Docker daemon. For example:
Add the line below to the `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file:

```bash
-w /usr/bin/dockerd -k docker
```
Then, restart the audit daemon using the following command
```bash
systemctl restart auditd
```

### Default Value

By default, the Docker daemon is not audited.
