## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file individual ownership and group
ownership is correctly set to `root`.

The `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the
behavior of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be individually owned and group
owned by `root` to ensure that it is not modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chown root:root /etc/sysconfig/docker
```

This sets the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system, and in this case, this recommendation is not applicable.
