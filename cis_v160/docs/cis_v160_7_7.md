## Description

You should rotate swarm node certificates in line with your organizational security policy.

Docker Swarm uses TLS for clustering operations between its nodes. Certificate rotation ensures that in an event such as a compromised node or key, it is difficult to impersonate a node. By default, node certificates are rotated every 90 days, but you should rotate them more often or as appropriate in your environment.

## Remediation

You should run the command to set the desired expiry time on the node certificate. For example:

```bash
docker swarm update --cert-expiry 48h
```

### Default Value:

By default, node certificates are rotated automatically every 90 days.
