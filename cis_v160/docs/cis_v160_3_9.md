## Description

You should verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed along with the `--tlscacert` parameter) is individually owned and group owned by `root`.

The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is used to authenticate the Docker server based on a given CA certificate. It must be therefore be individually owned and group owned by `root` to ensure that it cannot be modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

The following command could be executed:

```bash
chown root:root <path to TLS CA certificate file>
```

This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the TLS CA certificate file to `root`.

### Default Value

By default, the ownership and group-ownership for TLS CA certificate file is correctly set to `root`.
