## Overview

There are many security implications associated with the ways that containers are started. Some runtime parameters can be supplied that have security consequences that could compromise the host and the containers running on it. It is therefore very important to verify the way in which containers are started, and which parameters are associated with them. Container runtime configuration should be reviewed in line with organizational security policy.
