## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/default/docker `file permissions are correctly set to `644`
or more restrictively

The `/etc/default/docker` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior
of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be writeable only by `root` in order to ensure
that it is not modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chmod 644 /etc/default/docker
```

This sets the file permissions for this file to `644`.

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system and in this case, this recommendation is not applicable.
