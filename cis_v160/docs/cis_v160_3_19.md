## Description

You should verify that the `/etc/default/docker` file ownership and group-ownership is
correctly set to `root`

The `/etc/default/docker` file contains sensitive parameters that may alter the behavior
of the Docker daemon. It should therefore be individually owned and group owned by
`root` to ensure that it cannot be modified by less privileged users.

## Remediation

You should execute the following command

```bash
chown root:root /etc/default/docker
```

This sets the ownership and group ownership of the file to `root`.

### Default Value

This file may not be present on the system, and in this case, this recommendation is not applicable.
