## Description

The `--live-restore` option enables full support of daemon-less containers within Docker. It ensures that Docker does not stop containers on shutdown or restore and that it properly reconnects to the container when restarted.

One of the important security triads is availability. Setting the `--live-restore` flag within the Docker daemon ensures that container execution is not interrupted when it is not available. This also makes it easier to update and patch the Docker daemon without application downtime.

## Remediation

Run Docker in daemon mode and pass `--live-restore` to it as an argument.
For Example,

```bash
dockerd --live-restore
```

### Default Value:

By default, --live-restore is not enabled.
