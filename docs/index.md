## References

[CIS Docker Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org) provide a predefined set of compliance and security best-practice checks for Docker resources.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.

## Documentation

- **[Benchmarks and controls →](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/docker_compliance/controls)**
- **[Named queries →](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/docker_compliance/queries)**

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the Docker plugins with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install docker
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-docker-compliance.git
```

### Usage

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser
window at http://localhost:9194. From here, you can run benchmarks by
selecting one or searching for a specific one.

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `steampipe check` command:

Run all benchmarks:

```sh
steampipe check all
```

Run a single benchmark:

```sh
steampipe check benchmark.cis_v160_5
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
steampipe check control.cis_v160_5_1
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe Docker plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/docker).

### Configuration

No extra configuration is required.
