## References

[CIS Docker Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org) provide a predefined set of compliance and security best-practice checks for Docker resources.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.

## Geting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Docker plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/docker) and the [Exec plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/exec) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

Install the Docker and Exec plugins with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install docker exec
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Docker credentials.

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-docker-compliance
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **https://localhost:9033**.

### Running Checks in Your Terminal

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `powerpipe benchmark` command:

List available benchmarks:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark list
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
powerpipe benchmark run docker_compliance.benchmark.cis_v160_5
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://powerpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/benchmark#output-formats).
